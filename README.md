# ENTROPYMAX2.0

A modernized version of the EntropyMax application for geological and geophysical analysis and data processing.

## Project Overview

ENTROPYMAX2.0 is a complete rewrite and modernization of the original EntropyMax application. The project aims to provide enhanced entropy analysis capabilities with a modern, maintainable codebase.

## Legacy Code

The original VB6 application is preserved in the `legacy/` directory for reference and analysis. This includes:
- Original source files (Form1.frm, Module1.bas, etc.)
- Compiled executable (EntropyMax.exe)
- Documentation (EMAX.chm)
- Installation packages

## Development Status

This project is currently in the initial planning and setup phase. The legacy codebase has been organized and the new project structure is being established.

### Project Setup Status
✅ Repository created and transferred to cits3002-group-31 organization  
✅ Legacy VB6 code organized and preserved  
✅ Modern project structure established  
✅ Git repository configured and ready for development  

### Next Development Steps
1. Analyze the legacy VB6 code to understand the entropy analysis algorithms
2. Design the modern architecture for the new application
3. Choose appropriate technology stack (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
4. Begin implementing core entropy analysis functions
5. Create modern user interface
6. Set up automated testing and CI/CD
