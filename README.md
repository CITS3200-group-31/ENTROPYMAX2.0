# ENTROPYMAX2.0

A modernized version of the EntropyMax application for geological and geophysical analysis and data processing.

## Project Overview

ENTROPYMAX2.0 is a complete rewrite and modernization of the original EntropyMax application. The project aims to provide enhanced entropy analysis capabilities with a modern, maintainable codebase.

## Legacy Code

The original VB6 application is preserved in the `legacy/` directory for reference and analysis. This includes:
- Original source files (Form1.frm, Module1.bas, etc.)
- Compiled executable (EntropyMax.exe)
- Documentation (EMAX.chm)
- Installation packages

## Development Status

This project is currently in the initial planning and setup phase. The legacy codebase has been organized and the new project structure is being established.
