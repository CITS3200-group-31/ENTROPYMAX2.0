### Meeting: Project Retrospective with Client

### Date/Time
- 14/09/2025, 16:00–17:35

### Attendees
- Present: Jeremy, Dongkai, Stephen, Piers, Ingrid
- Absent: None

### Agenda
- Frontend demo and user flow
- System explanation and graphs
- Client feedback and improvement requests
- Export formats and publishing considerations
- Action items and next meeting

### Demo and Current State
- Frontend walkthrough (Dongkai)
  - Map display; CSV and GPS inputs shown
  - Grain size data shape is stable; GPS may vary (out of scope per client; users ensure validity)
  - Suggested: an example input reference (image or sample files)
  - Data sizes vary; default K range 2–20 acceptable; up to ~1000 points on map
  - Selecting data and zooming work well; UI is appropriately minimal
  - Proposed improvements for map markers: clearer circle with group number; possibly color variations; replace “i” with group number
  - Provide both a broad map and a detailed map with numbers for publication
  - Info popup on point click is useful; list sorting by group/sample helpful
  - Highlighting selected points in green is helpful
  - Defaulting to highest K is acceptable but not always optimal
  - Ability to select points from the map desired

### Discussion and Feedback (Piers & Ingrid)
- Needs
  - Select a region (e.g., ~50 points), then work on a different subset (sub-list; filter to selected points)
  - Map arrows not essential for scope; can be added later if needed
  - Minimal drawing tools are sufficient
- Improvements
  - Click on R graph (or add a control) to switch K groups; compare by clicking different points
  - Grain size graphs should use logarithmic scale
  - Measurement capability in toolbar area (nice-to-have)
  - Identify which line corresponds to which sample ID
- Exports & Publishing
  - Export graphs as images; optionally editable (e.g., Excel). Ensure lines/labels are publication-ready (thickness, resizable)
  - Export map as KML and as image (export what’s on screen)
  - Export data as Excel for downstream editing
- Data/format expectations
  - Input formats likely consistent with examples; lat/long in separate file acceptable
- Longer-term ideas
  - Temporal data column and per-point timeline views (future)
  - Baseline hardware specs exploration
- Documentation for publication: describe program usage and study context

### Decisions
- Maintain a minimal, clear UI; emphasize group number visibility on markers
- Provide example input reference in the app
- Prioritize K-switching interaction on graphs

### Action Items
- Steve: Email minutes to Piers
- Steve: Follow up on new test data with GPS
- Steve & Dongkai: Send *.exe to Steve and Ingrid for testing
- Jeremy: Combine these minutes with group retrospective minutes in MS Teams

### Next Meeting
- Wednesday, 17/09/2025 — Group Project Retrospective
