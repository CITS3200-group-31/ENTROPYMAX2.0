### Retrospective: Tracking vs Goals
- Set up Project Repository

    - GitHub with Issues and Project Kanban: Complete; in use; Kanban needs cleanup; Issues used well; improve assignment frequency
    - Substantial README: Complete
    - Repo structure/architecture: Ensure Wiki matches docs (ongoing)
- Implement Data Input and Output
  - Ends and middle are ready; integration pending
  - Acceptance criteria
    - CSV parser: Done (backend)
    - Error handling: Done (backend)
    - Convert to programmable form: Done (backend to parquet; consumed by frontend via intermediate function)
    - Export processed tables to CSV: Complete; update when backend integrates fully
    - Export graphs to PNG: Basic export works; UI can improve
- Entropy Grouping Algorithm
  - Implement algorithm: Complete
  - Verify vs old program: Complete (tests against sample files)
  - Documentation: In code; consider consolidating with legacy docs
  - Geographic locations integration: Complete
- Simple UI
  - Design and implement (PyQt): Complete; workflow improved; add example input
  - Graphs present; add save/export buttons to reduce right‑click reliance
- Tests and CI/CD
  - Pre-merge checks: Managed via branch discipline and single-source merges; full CI deferred
  - Unit tests for inputs/outputs: Complete
  - Edge cases: Discussed with client; example data collected; input validation in place
  - Test documentation: Complete (README and backend docs)

### Timeline Review
- Expected: Most Sprint 2 criteria hit; anticipate similar for Sprint 3
- Observed: Deadlines met; could be more date-specific; some items slipped due to technical issues/miscommunication; current targets met per client/mentor
- Discrepancies: Waiting on example data; client holidays delayed clarifications

### General Reflections
- Ensure proper hour logging
- Strong team collaboration
- Improve communication on model flow (focus for Sprint 3)

### Decisions
- Defer full CI to prioritize features; maintain disciplined merges
- UI to prioritize clarity and minimalism; add example input

### Action Items
- Steve: Submit client minutes to Piers via email — Done
- Steve: Follow up on new test data (with GPS) — Done
- Steve, Dongkai: Send *.exe to Steve and Ingrid to try — Do next week
- Jeremy: Combine these minutes with client retrospective minutes in MS Teams — Done
- Everyone: Personal reflections and SparkPlus — Due Friday

### Next Meeting
