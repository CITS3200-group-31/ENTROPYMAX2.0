## Proposed Features for EntropyMax 2.0

### 1. Automated Grain-Size Grouping & Curves

Replace manual Excel work: program must ingest a CSV, run the 2-to-20-group "entropy" routine, and auto-plot frequency/log-size curves and individual particle-size-distribution (PSD) graphs.

Output graphs need adjustable scaling, clear group-bands, and publishable aesthetics.

### 2. Automatic Spatial Export

After processing, generate a KMZ file that ties each sample's modal group to its geographic coordinates so results open directly in Google Earth (no hand typing).

### 3. Mapping & Pathway Visualisation

UI should let the user pick several locations and display how modal grain size progresses along a hypothesised transport path on the seabed.

### 4. Modern, User-Friendly GUI

Single interface to: choose input CSV, set output file name, select composite vs. per-group outputs, watch progress, view graphs.

Goal: "nice GUI" that new users can operate without coding or Excel hacks.

### 5. Improved Output Management

Produce smaller, cleaner result files; avoid "too-big Excel" issues.

Export raw results plus enriched visuals (PNG/PDF) in one run.

### 6. Error-Free Automation

Eliminate manual steps that currently introduce copy-paste mistakes (e.g., matching sample names when mapping).

### 7. Extensibility & Publishability

Codebase should be clean enough to extend to other sediment-profile inputs, and polished enough to underpin a journal or conference publication.
