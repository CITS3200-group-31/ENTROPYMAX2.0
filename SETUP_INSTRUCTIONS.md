gh repo transfer ENTROPYMAX2.0 Group-31 --yes
```

Alternatively, you can do it through the web interface:
1. Go to https://github.com/unixthat/ENTROPYMAX2.0
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Danger Zone"
4. Click "Transfer ownership"

After the repository is transferred to the organization:

1. Go to the organization settings: https://github.com/organizations/Group-31/settings
2. Navigate to "Teams" in the sidebar
3. Create a new team for the project
4. Add the six team members (including yourself)

### 4. Repository Access

Once transferred, the repository will be available at:
https://github.com/Group-31/ENTROPYMAX2.0

## Project Structure Summary

The project has been organized with the following structure:

```
ENTROPYMAX2.0/

│   ├── src/               # Source files (.frm, .bas, .vbp)
│   ├── bin/               # Executables

└── .gitignore            # Git ignore rules
```

## Next Development Steps

1. Analyze the legacy VB6 code to understand the entropy analysis algorithms
2. Design the modern architecture for the new application
3. Choose appropriate technology stack (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
4. Begin implementing core entropy analysis functions
5. Create modern user interface
6. Set up automated testing and CI/CD
