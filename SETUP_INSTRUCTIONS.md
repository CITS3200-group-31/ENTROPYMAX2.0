```

## Next Development Steps

1. Analyze the legacy VB6 code to understand the entropy analysis algorithms
2. Design the modern architecture for the new application
3. Choose appropriate technology stack (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
4. Begin implementing core entropy analysis functions
5. Create modern user interface
6. Set up automated testing and CI/CD
