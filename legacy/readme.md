# Legacy (Archived)

This directory contains the original VB6 EntropyMax sources and audits. It is preserved for reference only and is not part of the active codebase.

- Start here for an overview of what to port and what to drop: `legacy_readme.md`
- VB6 algorithm and file inventory: `readme.md`
- VB6 project files: `EntropyMax.vbp`, `Form1.frm`, `Module1.bas`

Active implementation lives under `backend/` (C) and `frontend/` / `src/app` (Python/GUI). See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/PORTING_GUIDE.md` for the working plan and mappings.
